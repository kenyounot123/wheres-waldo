# Photo tagging app (Wheres Waldo variation)

This project is a photo tagging web application that allows users to identify specific characters within a large photograph. It's inspired by games like "Where's Waldo?".

# Features

- Users can click on areas of the photo to create a targeting box.
- A dropdown list within the targeting box allows users to select characters.
- Tracks the time taken from the photo load to the final identification of all characters.
- Stores and displays user completion times and names.

# How I made it

- Used React as the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend
- Rails was used to handle api requests and responses as well as managing the database schema and changes.
- React was used to create resusable UI components like the targeting box and dropdowns
- Also used React to handle api calls to the Rails backend
